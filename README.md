## What is Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider.

## Benefits of Cloud computing
There are four main benefits of cloud computing.

**Agility:** The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need themâ€“from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.

**Elasticity:** The ability to provision the amount of resources you actually need by being able to scale up or down to grow or shrink capacity in line with business needs.

**Cost Savings:** Using the cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (ie data centers and pysical servers) for variable expenses. This allows a customer the flexibility to pat for IT as they consume it, also taking advantage of the cloud providers economies of scale.

**Ability to Deploy Globally in Minutes**
With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.
